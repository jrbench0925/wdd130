            <p>Hello! My name is Jeff Bench and I am from Blackfoot, Idaho. I currently work for a wellness company. In my free time I enjoy being outside, riding my motorcycle, or going to concerts.
                I have lived in Eastern Idaho the majority of my life but have also spent time in Southern Idaho and Utah. 
                I have a degree in business management and currently work for a local wellness company as an internal auditor. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently slowly learning photography so that gives me an excuse to get out and experience everything Idaho has to offer. I'm not going to be a professional any time soon but it's a fun hobby.
                I also attend as many concerts as possible. For as long as I can remember, I have loved music. In my best year I saw more than 70 bands. This eyar alone I went to a festival that was over 13 hours long and had more than 50 bands playing.
            </p>

            <p>Idaho is a state in the northwestern United States. Idaho is the 43rd state. It became a state in 1890. The capital city of Boise, located in the western part of the state, is it's largest city. It is bordered by Washington and Oregon to the west, Canada to the north, Montana to the north and east, wyoming on the east, and Utah and Nevada to the south. Idaho may be famous for potatoes but the best part is the scenery and wildlife.</p>
